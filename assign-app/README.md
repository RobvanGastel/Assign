## CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

#### How to install
Using the default Ruby install can require you to use sudo when installing gems. Make sure you're using Xcode 7 or 8.
```
# Xcode 7 + 8
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```
Now you can install the dependencies in your project:
```
$ pod install
```
